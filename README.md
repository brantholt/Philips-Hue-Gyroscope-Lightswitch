Philips Hue Gyroscope Lightswitch
=================================

This Mobile Web App makes use of the DeviceMotion Events produced when a devices' gyroscope senses motion. The values given when the phone tilts get converted into brightness and color values that get sent, via Asynchronus AJAX calls, to the 'Hue Base', which in turn applies the commands to the lightbulbs themeselves.
